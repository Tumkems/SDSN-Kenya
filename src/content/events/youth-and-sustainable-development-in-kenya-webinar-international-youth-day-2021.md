desc: '<p>The theme of International Youth Day 2021 is, “<strong>Transforming Food
  Systems: Youth Innovation for Human and Planetary Health</strong>”, with the aim
  of exploring the role that youth can play to achieve more equitable and sustainable
  food systems</p><p class="p1">Through a unique dialogue among youth working in this
  space and stakeholders from different walks of life, the webinar will seek to promote
  innovation, knowledge exchange, and youth engagement in the food production cycle</p><p
  class="p1">The webinar is structured to boost interactions among the participants.
  The different segments will focus on specific topics that fall under the overarching
  theme of Transforming Food Systems, including: planetary health, nutrition, health,
  education, innovation, and Indigenous youth.</p><p>SDSN Kenya, Youth Division, acknowledges
  the need for inclusive support mechanisms that ensure youth continue to amplify
  efforts collectively and individually to restore the planet and protect life, while
  integrating biodiversity in the transformation of food systems. With the world’s
  population expected to increase by 2 billion people in the next 30 years, it has
  become recognized by numerous stakeholders that simply producing a larger volume
  of healthier food more sustainably will not ensure human and planetary wellbeing.
  Other crucial challenges must also be addressed, such as the interlinkages embodied
  by the 2030 Agenda including poverty reduction; social inclusion; health care; biodiversity
  conservation; and climate change mitigation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">By this webinar,
  SDSN Kenya seeks to highlight the ways in which the engagement of young people at
  the local, national and global levels is contributing towards the agenda 2030, 2063
  and beyond, as well as draw lessons on how their representation and engagement in
  formal food security debate and action can be significantly enhanced.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Why?
  2015 marked the adoption of historic agendas for Africa at both the continental
  and global levels. At the continental level, African countries have adopted Agenda
  2063, the 50-year Transformative Agenda for Africa. At the global level, the UN
  General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable
  Development Goals (SDGs). Both frameworks seek to achieve inclusive growth, sustainable
  development, and peace and security for the continent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The
  objectives of this event are to:</p><ul><li><p>Accelerate the youth agenda and realize
  the UN roadmap to addressing food security challenges in Kenya and Africa through
  agenda 2030 and agenda 2063</p></li></ul><p>· advancing of youth innovation and
  entrepreneurship for achieving SDGs</p><ul><li><p>Gain a thorough understanding
  of the role of youth engagement in Kenya and Africa in general and present positive
  experiences of youth-led food production initiatives</p></li><li><p>A call to action
  to scale up youth engagement efforts for the SDGs at the national and continental
  level</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Cement the need to make youth voices heard and make
  them the principal agents of decision making where youth are concerned.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Agenda</strong></h4><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>
