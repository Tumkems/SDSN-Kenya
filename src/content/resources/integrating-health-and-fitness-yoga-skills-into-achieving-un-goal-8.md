title: integrating Health and fitness (Yoga) skills into achieving UN Goal 8
desc: '<p>Over the past 25 years, the number of workers living in extreme poverty
  has declined dramatically, despite the lasting impact of the 2008 economic crisis
  and global recession. In developing countries, the middle class now makes up more
  than 34 percent of total employment â€“ a number that has almost tripled between 1991
  and 2015. However, as the global economy continues to recover we are seeing slower
  growth, widening inequalities, and not enough jobs to keep up with a growing labor
  force. According to the International Labour Organization, more than 204 million
  people were unemployed in 2015. The SDGs promote sustained economic growth, higher
  levels of productivity, and technological innovation. Encouraging entrepreneurship
  and job creation are key to this, as are effective measures to eradicate forced
  labor, slavery, and human trafficking. With these targets in mind, the goal is to
  achieve full and productive employment, and decent work, for all women and men by
  2030. Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth | UNDP "Good Health and Well-being",
  is also one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations
  in 2015. The official wording is: "To ensure healthy lives and promote well-being
  for all at all ages." The targets of SDG 3 cover and focus on various aspects of
  a healthy life and a healthy lifestyle. Progress towards the targets is measured
  using twenty-one indicators.</p>'
